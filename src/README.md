# Budget Manager â€“ Stage 4: Memorable purchases

---

## ðŸ§  Description

What's the point of counting the money if the results are lost and forgotten once you close the program? To allow for some long-term budget planning, we need to save purchases to file. Add items Save and Load to the menu.

`Save` should save all purchases to the file.

`Load` should load all purchases from the file.

Use the `purchases.txt` file to store purchases.
